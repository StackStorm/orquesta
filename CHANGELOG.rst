Fixed
~~~~~

* Fix unreachable join when an inbound task fails as defined in the task transition. (bug fix)

1.3.0
-----

Added
~~~~~

* Implement the orquesta-rehearse command to run unit tests for workflow. (new feature, beta)
  Contributed by AJ (guzzijones)

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Remove mistral fixtures because they were used as ref to support multiple specs. Mistral is
  deprecated in StackStorm and there's no intention to support it here. A mistral to orquesta
  workflow conversion tool is available at https://github.com/StackStorm/orquestaconvert.

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fix the custom flake8 extensions to check import statements. (bug fix)
* Fix the deprecation warning that flags are not at the start of the expression. (bug fix)

1.2.0
-----

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Run pep8 and docs in tox with python3.
* Use black https://pypi.org/project/black/ for code formatting.
* Update tox to return error if there are uncommitted schema changes.

Fixed
~~~~~

* Warn users when there is a loop and no start task identified. (bug fix)
* Lock global variables during initialization to make them thread safe. (bug fix)
* Workflow stuck in running if one or more items failed in a with items task. (bug fix)
* Fix use case where a failed with items task is run again if the task is in a cycle. (bug fix)

1.1.1
-----

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fix task retry where transition on error is also executed along with retry. (bug fix)

1.1.0
-----

Added
~~~~~

* Add feature to retry task execution on given condition with delay in between retries and
  max number of retries. (new feature)
  Contributed by Hiroyasu Ohyama (@userlocalhost) and Nick Maludy (@nmaludy)
* Add support to rerun completed workflow (failed or succeeded) from given task(s). (new feature)

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Replace "noop" with "continue" when "do" is not specified. The new "continue" command
  will not alter the previous task state and will continue to conduct the workflow
  execution. StackStorm/st2#4740 (improvement)
* Refactor conductor to not store each item result in task state. If there are a lot of items
  and/or result size is huge per item, then there will be a performance impact on database
  write operations when recording the conductor state. (improvement)
* Use ujson to deepcopy dict(s) for faster performance. (improvement)
* Refactor how inbound criteria for join task is evaluated to count by task completion
  instead of task transition. (improvement)

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fix conducting of cycle with a fork. Fixes #169 (bug fix)
* Fix request_workflow_status to ignore certain status change errors such as pausing a workflow
  that is already pausing and canceling a workflow that is already canceling. (bug fix)
* Remove rendering of workflow output automatically when updating task state. This caused
  workflow output to render incorrectly in certain use case. The render_workflow_output function
  must be called separately. (bug fix)
* When inspecting custom YAQL/Jinja function to see if there is a context arg, use getargspec
  for py2 and getfullargspec for py3. (bug fix)
* Check syntax on with items task to ensure action is indented correctly. Fixes #184 (bug fix)
* Fix variable inspection where ctx().get() method calls are identified as errors.
  Fixes StackStorm/st2#4866 (bug fix)
* Fix a problem of TypeError orccuring when a list (or dict) value that contains unhashable typed
  value (list or dict) is passed in some YAQL operators (e.g. distinct()). Fixes #176 (bug fix)
  Contributed by Hiroyasu Ohyama (@userlocalhost)

* Rephrased the error message for the unreachable join task. Fixes #162 (improvement)

Fixed
~~~~~

* Allow tasks in the same transition with a "fail" command to run. (bug fix)

Fixed
~~~~~

* Fix conductor performance for complex workflow definition. (bug fix)

* Fix with items task stuck in running when item(s) failed. (bug fix)

Fixed
~~~~~

* Value in quotes in shorthand publish should be evaluated as string type. Fixes #130 (bug fix)
* Fix interpretation of boolean value in shorthand format of publish. Fixes #119 (bug fix)
* Update YAQL section in docs on use of "=>" for named parameters in function calls. Closes #124
* Fix with items intepretor to handle variables that contain the word 'in'. (bug fix)

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Allow workflow to output on other completed states such as error. (improvement)
* Allow multiple transition between two tasks. (improvement)
